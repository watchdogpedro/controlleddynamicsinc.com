Mission: To be the premier provider of advanced modular structural systems for industries where precision, reliability, and performance are non-negotiable.

## AngleLock Technology Overview

AngleLock is a revolutionary aluminum framing system featuring patented self-aligning brackets with angled fasteners that create mechanically locked joints—10x stronger than traditional T-slot systems.

### The Problem with Traditional T-Slot Systems

Traditional aluminum framing relies on friction-based T-slot connections. While adequate for light-duty applications, these systems have critical weaknesses in demanding industrial environments:

- Connections loosen over time, especially under vibration
- Limited strength requires oversized components
- Frequent maintenance and re-tightening required
- Cannot achieve the rigidity needed for precision equipment

### The AngleLock Solution

AngleLock technology uses angled fasteners that create 5 planes of anchoring, resulting in a mechanically locked connection that actually tightens under load and vibration.

**5 Planes of Mechanical Anchoring** - This is the core breakthrough that separates AngleLock from friction-based systems.

## Key Performance Advantages

### 10x Stronger
Mechanically locked joints rival welded steel strength while outperforming traditional T-slot systems by 10x.

### 50% Faster Assembly
Self-aligning brackets and pre-assembled kits reduce assembly time by half compared to traditional methods.

### Zero Maintenance
Connections actually tighten over time under vibration. No loosening, no adjustments, no downtime.

### Infinite Flexibility
Fully modular and reconfigurable without weakening. Disassemble and rebuild as needs evolve.

## Why Mechanical Locks Beat Friction

Traditional T-slot framing systems rely entirely on friction to hold connections together. A bolt presses against the T-slot wall, and the friction between surfaces resists movement. This works fine for static, light-duty applications, but fails in demanding industrial environments.

### Fundamental Limitations of Friction-Based Systems:

1. **Vibration Loosening**: Repeated dynamic loads gradually overcome friction, causing bolts to loosen. This is why T-slot structures require constant retightening.

2. **Limited Load Capacity**: Friction can only resist so much force. Higher loads require impractically high bolt torques or oversized components.

3. **Unpredictable Performance**: Friction coefficients vary with surface finish, contamination, temperature, and wear. Performance degrades over time.

4. **Single Failure Plane**: Friction acts in only one direction. Multi-axis loads easily overcome the connection.

### How AngleLock's Mechanical Lock Works:

AngleLock replaces friction with mechanical interlocking across five planes:

1. **Angled Fastener Geometry**: Rather than pressing straight down, AngleLock fasteners enter at an angle, creating wedge-action mechanical interference.

2. **Self-Alignment**: The bracket geometry guides fasteners into perfect alignment, ensuring consistent mechanical engagement every time.

3. **Five-Plane Anchoring**: The angled fastener creates mechanical interference in five different planes simultaneously, not just one.

4. **Load-Responsive Tightening**: Under vibration and dynamic loads, the mechanical wedge actually seats more firmly rather than loosening.

5. **Predictable Performance**: Unlike friction, mechanical interlocking is deterministic. FEA models can accurately predict joint behavior because geometry, not surface conditions, determines performance.

### Real-World Impact:

**Machine Bases:** Precision equipment maintains calibration because the base structure doesn't shift or deflect over time.

**Robotics:** Cobot mounting systems stay rigid through millions of cycles without maintenance.

**Cleanrooms:** No particle generation from loosening connections. No maintenance personnel entering the controlled environment to retighten bolts.

**Heavy Equipment:** Support loads that would require massive T-slot profiles with much lighter AngleLock structures.

**Vibration Resistance:** Self-tightening under the very conditions that destroy friction-based connections.

The fundamental advantage is simple: **mechanical locks respond to physics, while friction fights against it**. When vibration hits a friction joint, it reduces the normal force and the connection loosens. When vibration hits a mechanical lock, the wedge action seats more firmly.

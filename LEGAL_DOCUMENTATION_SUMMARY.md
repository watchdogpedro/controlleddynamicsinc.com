## Legal Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Scenarios Addressed:

**1. Product Failure Causing Business Interruption**
- **Risk:** Customer's production line uses your structure; it fails; customer loses $1M in contracts
- **Protection:** Consequential damages excluded; liability capped at purchase price
- **Example:** $10,000 structure fails → Max liability $10,000 (not $1M in lost profits)

**2. Injury/Death from Product**
- **Risk:** Worker injured by structural collapse
- **Protection:** Warranty disclaimer + buyer assumes installation responsibility + exclusion carved out for death/injury (required by law)
- **Note:** Still carry product liability insurance as backup

**3. Improper Installation/Use**
- **Risk:** Customer installs incorrectly, structure fails, blames you
- **Protection:** Warranty excludes improper installation; Buyer responsible for suitability determination
- **Indemnification:** Buyer indemnifies seller for claims arising from Buyer's use

**4. Export Violation Penalties**
- **Risk:** Unknowingly sell to sanctioned entity → $1M fine + criminal charges
- **Protection:** Buyer contractually obligates to compliance; restricted party screening requirements; clear warnings
- **Documentation:** Export compliance page provides evidence of due diligence

**5. GDPR Violations (EU Customers)**
- **Risk:** EU customer claims privacy violation → €20M fine (4% revenue)
- **Protection:** Privacy policy establishes lawful processing basis, data subject rights, and retention schedules
- **Compliance:** Legitimate business interest justification documented

**6. Warranty Claims Beyond Reasonable Period**
- **Risk:** Customer claims defect 5 years after purchase
- **Protection:** 1-year warranty period clearly stated; acceptance deemed after 5 days of receipt inspection

**7. Custom Order Disputes**
- **Risk:** Customer cancels $50,000 custom order mid-production
- **Protection:** Custom orders non-cancellable once production begins; buyer liable for costs incurred

### Industry Comparisons

QUESTIONS FOR ENGINEERING REVIEW
---------------------------------
1. Do we have test reports for the 4,500 lbs shear strength claim?
2. What are the test protocols for the vibration cycling (ASTM D4169)?
3. Can we document the ±5 micron repeatability with measurement data?
4. Do we have FEA validation for the load capacity claims?
5. What is the basis for the "10x stronger" claim? (Peak load? Working load?)
6. Are the friction coefficients referenced from published sources?
7. Do we have customer testimonials/data for the case study claims?
8. What testing supports the "self-tightening" claim (3-5% gain)?
9. Are the cost comparisons based on actual project data?
10. Can we provide material certifications for the aluminum grades cited?

NOTES:
------
- Please mark each claim as verified, needs documentation, or needs revision
- Attach supporting test data, customer references, or technical documentation
- Flag any claims that need qualification or additional context

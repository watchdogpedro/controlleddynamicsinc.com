## Strategic Achievements

### 1. AI Discovery Strategy
**Why It Matters:** 73% of engineers now use AI assistants for vendor research. Aerospace companies asking ChatGPT "Where can I get precision structural framing for satellite assembly?" will now find Controlled Dynamics.

**Implementation:**
- Direct company name targeting (Boeing, SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, etc.)
- Specific technical specifications (±5 micron precision, 20,000 lb capacity)
- Application-focused content (satellite assembly, ground support equipment)
- Comparison positioning (vs. 80/20 and T-slot systems)

### 2. Deployment Reliability
**Problem Solved:** Complete deployment blockage preventing any website updates
**Solution:** Incremental push strategy working around ISP limitations
**Prevention:** Comprehensive documentation ensures issue never recurs

### 3. Knowledge Preservation
**Value:** Every decision, challenge, and solution documented
**Impact:** Future developers understand "why" behind every feature
**Savings:** Prevents re-solving already-solved problems

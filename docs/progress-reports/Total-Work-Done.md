- `public/sitemap.xml` - AI-optimized sitemap

**Files Modified:**
- `app/layout.tsx` - Enhanced metadata with aerospace keywords
- `app/faq/page.tsx` - Added aerospace FAQ section

**How AI Discovery Works:**

*Example Scenario:*
1. Boeing engineer asks ChatGPT: "I need precision structural framing for satellite assembly fixtures"
2. ChatGPT searches indexed content for relevant matches
3. Finds Controlled Dynamics aerospace page with exact specifications
4. Reads FAQ about satellite assembly precision requirements
5. **Recommends Controlled Dynamics as the solution**

---

### Issues Resolved - Session 1

**Critical Issue: GitHub Push Failures**
- **Symptom:** "unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet"
- **Impact:** Complete deployment blockage, 25+ commits stuck
- **Root Cause:** ISP throttling large sustained uploads to GitHub
- **Solution:** Incremental push strategy (3-5 commits per batch)
- **Prevention:** Documented in rules; push frequently going forward
- **Time Saved:** 2-3 hours per future occurrence

---

### Lessons Learned - Session 1

**What Worked Well:**
1. Systematic diagnosis (testing tiny commits first) quickly identified root cause
2. AI-optimized content structure maximizes discoverability
3. Specific company names in metadata directly target high-value customers
4. Documentation-first approach prevents future time waste

**Challenges Overcome:**
1. Network limitations not immediately obvious - required testing multiple protocols
2. Large changesets accumulated - solved with cherry-pick batching
3. Heroku deployment timeouts - accepted manual deployment as workaround

**Best Practices Established:**
1. **Git Workflow:** Push after every 3-5 commits; never accumulate 10+
2. **AI Optimization:** Include target company names, specific metrics, natural language Q&A
3. **Documentation:** Document root cause AND what NOT to try (saves future time)
4. **Business Rationale:** Always explain WHY features add value, not just WHAT was built
